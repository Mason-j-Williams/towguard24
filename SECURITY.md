Purpose Limitation: Data is used solely to provide and improve TowGuard24 services.

User Control: Users may request access, correction, or deletion of their data.

Secure Storage: Sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit.
Encryption & Secure Transmission
All communication between devices and TowGuard24 servers uses TLS 1.3.

Sensitive data stored in our systems is encrypted using AES‑256 or stronger.

API requests are authenticated and signed to prevent tampering.

Administrative access is logged, monitored, and reviewed regularly.

Passwords are hashed using industry‑standard algorithms.

Multi‑layer authentication is enforced for internal systems.
Infrastructure Security
TowGuard24 uses secure, industry‑trusted cloud infrastructure with redundancy.

Firewalls, network segmentation, and intrusion detection systems protect our environment.

Regular vulnerability scans and security audits are performed.

Environment variables and keys are stored securely and never committed to code repositories.
Application Security
Code is reviewed for security risks before deployment.

Continuous monitoring detects suspicious activity or unauthorized access attempts.

Rate limiting and abuse‑prevention systems protect against malicious use.

Third‑party libraries are monitored for vulnerabilities and updated promptly.
